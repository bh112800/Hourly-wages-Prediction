# Hourly-wages-Prediction

In this repo, prediction of optimal hourly wages on panel data using SAS is implemented by pre-processing the workerâ€™s panel data and fitting a best-fitting fixed and random effect model using SAS to control
the unobserved heterogeneity in the data and determining the optimal hourly wage for each worker based on their performance and financial factors in the various periods.
